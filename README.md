Fire Detection System using Arduino ðŸ”¥

This project demonstrates a simple fire detection system using an Arduino Uno and a flame sensor. When a flame is detected, the Arduino activates a relay, triggering a water pump to extinguish the fire automatically. The system is ideal for basic fire detection applications in controlled environments.
Components:

    Arduino Uno
    Flame Sensor
    Single Channel Relay
    Water Pump
